  <!-- default MarketValue is 1.20 for wood -->

  <!-- Adjusting the "stuffProps/statFactors/MarketValue" fails to have an in-game effect
  on the value of things like shelves and walls. The default value is 0.40 for stone,
  probably 1.00 for wood? -->

  <!-- per experiments, walls have a base value of around $3.30. -->
